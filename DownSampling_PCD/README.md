// quick Example of how Downsampling works when handlign PCD data from a lidar laser
// Downsampling reduces the resolution in a voxel grid or cell thus also helping reduce the processing time when processing point cloud data when running certain algorithms. as well as removing uncessesary data from each cell.
// Example From : https://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/voxel_grid.html

// the output of the example will show the size of the .pcd data before filtering and after. You will see the difference in the size of the data after downsampling
